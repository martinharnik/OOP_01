# Data: Attributes that hold information about the state of an object.
# Function: Methods that define the behavior of an object and can manipulate its data.
# Class: A blueprint for creating instances of that class.
# __init__ method: A constructor that initializes the object's attributes.
# dunder __init__ method: A special method in Python classes, also known as a constructor, that is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. It initializes the object's attributes.
# Class variables: Variables that are shared among all instances of a class.
# Class methods: Methods that are bound to the class and not the instance. They can modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.
# Static methods: Methods that are bound to the class and not the instance. They do not modify class or instance state and are used for utility functions.

# Inheritance: A mechanism where a new class inherits attributes and methods from an existing class.
# isinstance: A function that checks if an object is an instance of a class or a tuple of classes.
# issubclass: A function that checks if a class is a subclass of another class or a tuple of classes.

# dunder __repr__ method: A special method in Python classes that returns a string representation of the object, which is useful for debugging. (__repr__ stands for "representation")
# dunder __str__ method: A special method in Python classes that returns a string representation of the object, which is useful for end users. (__str__ stands for "string")
