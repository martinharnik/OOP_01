# Data: Attributes that hold information about the state of an object.
# Function: Methods that define the behavior of an object and can manipulate its data.
# Class: A blueprint for creating instances of that class.
# __init__ method: A constructor that initializes the object's attributes.
# Class variables: Variables that are shared among all instances of a class.
# Class methods: Methods that are bound to the class and not the instance. They can modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.
# Static methods: Methods that are bound to the class and not the instance. They do not modify class or instance state and are used for utility functions.
